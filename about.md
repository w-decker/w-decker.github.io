# About Me!

I am a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the [Language, Intelligence and Thought (LIT) Lab](https://www.language-intelligence-thought.net/), where I work with [Prof. Anna (Anya) Ivanova](https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/anna-ivanova) in the School of Psychology.

I am interested in language and intelligence in the minds and brains of humans and machines. What/how do neural mechanisms allow us to accrue, store, manipulate and express knowledge of our world? How can neuroscience influence the architecture of artificial neural networks? What can AI tell us about language in the brain? These are a few general themes of my research interests.

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Louisiana State University (LSU) where I worked with [Christopher Cox](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/psychology/faculty/cognitive/cox.php) and [Julie M. Schneider](https://juschnei.wixsite.com/lendlab/dr-julie-m-schneider).

### Personal 

My favorite TV show is The Simpsons. But, right now I am watching: **Invader Zim**

In my free time, I play the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years) and code. I am no software engineer, though. I enjoy reading but mostly stick to science-y topics.

I also really like food and will eat practically anything. I'm not a big fan of raisins though.
