Hi! I'm Will Decker and I am an undergraduate honors student at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA, USA.

I am generally interested in how the mind and brain learn about their environment and how this information is then used to navigate the "real world". This pulls from many different domains within cognitive neuroscience, like language, semantic knowledge, visual neuroscience, attention and memory (to name a few) as well as many scientific fields adjacent to cog-neuro, like mathematics, computer science and linguistics (to name a few). Alltogether, I am interested in using cognitive (behavioral experiments), computational (statistical models), and neuroscientific (EEG and fMRI) tools to uncover the neural bases of learning in the human brain, with a particular emphasis on the infant brain, in which a primary objective exists to parse the novel, continuous, and complex information it constantly is bombarded with. 

On top of being a student, I am a Project Coordinator in the [Language, Environment and NeuroDevelopment (LEND) Lab](https://juschnei.wixsite.com/lendlab) under the mentorship of [Julie M. Schneider, PhD](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/comd/faculty/schneider.php) where I have learned lots about EEG and the signal processing operations behind it and lead a team of other undergraduates in learning and conducting EEG experiments. I am also an honors thesis student in the [Representations and Learning (ReLearn) Lab](https://faculty.lsu.edu/chriscox/index.php) under the mentorship of [Christopher Cox, PhD](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/psychology/faculty/cognitive/cox.php) where I have delved deep into MRI, statistical learning and much more.

I do enjoy my fair share of television; my favorite show is The Simpsons. In my free time, I enjoy walking around outside when the weather is nice and listening to my favorite song, "The Night Chicago Died" by Paper Lace, playing the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years), and coding (check out some of my cool coding projects/resourcs on my [GitHub](mysci.qmd#github) or in the [**Learning & Resources**](https://w-decker.github.io/mylearning.html) section).

At the moment, I am working towards entering a collaborative and open-science driven graduate program in Cognitive Psychology and/or Cognitive Neuroscience with opportunities to enhance my knowledge of language, neuroimaging, statistics and data science as well as receive detailed training in being a scientist of the brain.
