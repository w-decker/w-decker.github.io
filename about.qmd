Hi! I'm Will Decker and I am an undergraduate honors student at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA, USA.

Most notably, my interests fall within the field of cognitive neuroscience. I am generally curious about 1) learning, 2) language, 3) semantic knowledge and 4) neuroimaging. I am interested in how we learn and make sense of the complex visual, linguistic and auditory world around us. How do we learn language? How do we learn from, and extract meaning from complex visual, linguistic and auditory input? How do semantic systems and language systems interact? How can we understand the cognitive and computational mechanisms of learning and language using neuroimaging and computational models? These are just some of the many questions I am interested in pursuing. 

I am also severely interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.), their respective analyses and improvements to analyses (qualitatively and quantitatively). I am intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences our characterization of cognitive processes. Additionally, I am generally interested in and passionate about the structure-function relationship, open science, coding and statistics.

On top of being a student, I am a Project Coordinator in the [Language, Environment and NeuroDevelopment (LEND) Lab](https://juschnei.wixsite.com/lendlab) under the mentorship of [Julie M. Schneider, PhD](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/comd/faculty/schneider.php) where I have learned lots about EEG and the signal processing operations behind it and lead a team of other undergraduates in learning and conducting EEG experiments. I am also an honors thesis student in the [Representations and Learning (ReLearn) Lab](https://faculty.lsu.edu/chriscox/index.php) under the mentorship of [Christopher Cox, PhD](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/psychology/faculty/cognitive/cox.php) where I have delved deep into MRI, SL and much more.

Additionally, I am a big foodie and will eat practically anything. (Except raisins. Who wants a dried, shriveled grape when you can have a nice, juicy, good tasting one? They smell weird too.) I do enjoy my fair share of television; my favorite show--without a doubt--is The Simpsons. In my free time, I enjoy walking around outside when the weather is nice and listening to my favorite song, "The Night Chicago Died" by Paper Lace, playing the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years), and coding (check out some of my cool coding projects/resourcs in the [**Learning & Resources**](https://w-decker.github.io/mylearning.html) section).

At the moment, I am working towards entering a collaborative and open-science driven graduate program in Cognitive Psychology and/or Cognitive Neuroscience with opportunities to enhance my knowledge of language, neuroimaging, statistics and data science as well as receive detailed training in being a scientist of the brain.
