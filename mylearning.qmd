## What is this page for?

I have always felt that teaching a concept significantly increases one's own understanding of that concept. Recently, I have been building learning materials for a myriad of different concepts. Most of them are in progress at the moment but below are some that have some substance to learn from.

These topics range from mathematical concepts, to coding and more. Stay tuned for details on how to contribute. An effort is currently being made to convert these resources into static sites of their own.

On this page, I also provide access to some generic resources that might be helpful in a variety of situations.

## APA Compliant $\LaTeX$ Template

  </a>
</center>

$\LaTeX$ and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) are great resources for (collaboratively) writing documents with ease. There are a million $\LaTeX$ tutorials on YouTube. I recommend checking out [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/@DrTrefor). Nonetheless, I have provided a $\LaTeX$ template which follows APA criteria. To use it, complete the following steps:

1. Fork the GitHub repository
2. Create a new project in Overleaf
3. Select "Import from GitHub"
4. Select the forked "APA-Manuscript-Template" repo

And now you're ready to write!

## Multiple Regression (sub) Components `mrc`

R functions for computing some fun components to multiple regression models. Clicking the plot above will take you to the GitHub repo. To install `mrc` in R, type the following in the R console.

```R
devtools::install_github("w-decker/mrc")
```

## Python Object Oriented Programming (POOP)

Object oriented programming (OOP) is an interesting way of coding and is difficult compared to the canonical "procedural" way of programming. Here, I provide only an introductory explanation of OOP with Python. Thus, this learning tool is aptly named "POOP".

## Brain Stimulation with Izhikevich Model

</center>

The Izhikevich Model, developed in 2003, allows us to quantify the dynamic nature of neuronal circutry. Here, I provide an introduction to the mathematical models behind neuronal activity and using this to understand brain stimulation.

## Hidden Markov Models

  </a>
</center>

What is a hidden Markov model (HMM)? How is it used in cognitive neuroscience? Here I provide an understanding of the concepts underlying HMMs, HMMs in general, and relevant literature that makes use of Markovian processes. Click on the image above to learn more about HMMs!

## Building MATLAB Functions

  </a>
</center>

MATLAB is a powerful and widely used tool in cognitive neuroscience and building custom functions is important to optimizing your code. Here, I provide an understanding of building functions ranging in complexities.
