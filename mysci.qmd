It is important to practice what you preach! (See [**Open Science**](https://w-decker.github.io/opensci.html)). In this section, I provide open access to sites which house my current/in-progress and completed research. The following resources provide an in-depth account of a project-much more than a manuscript or presentation might be able to. Please check out [**Projects**](https://w-decker.github.io/currentprojects.html) for brief descriptions of some of what I am working on at the moment.

## GitHub

GitHub is an incredibly powerful tool for researchers, scientists and more across many fields. The role of GitHub can vary depending on the person. On my GitHub, you will find code used in a variety of projects, but I also use GitHub for writing (more on this soon!). I primarily work with Python, MATLAB and R and the majority of my GitHub consists of these languages. Click on the icon above to access my GitHub.

## OSF

The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a foundational tool in bolstering open science efforts. It is structured like a file folder system, with "Projects" being the main file, while subcomponents, like "Analysis" or "Code" being the files within. On my OSF, you will find a more detailed account of projects, an interface with GitHub to access code used in the project, and other components that typically make up a project, like the stimuli used and more. Click on the icon above to access my OSF.

## [Presentations](https://w-decker.github.io/Presentations)

First/co-author presentations from conferences/symposia or internal talks are usually uploaded to an offshoot of this site. Click the hyperlink in this section title to access my Presentations.
