It is important to practice what you preach! (See [Open Science](https://w-decker.github.io/opensci.html)) In this section, I provide open access to my current and completed research. The following resources provide an in-depth accounts of a project-much more than a manuscript might include. If you have any questions about materials, please do not hesitate to reach out. A section for direct access to presentations and (forthcoming) papers will be created within the coming weeks.

GitHub is an incredibly powerful tool for researchers, scientists and more across many fields. The role of GitHub can vary depending on the person. On my GitHub, you will find code used in a variety of projects. I primarily work with Python, MATLAB and R and the majority of my GitHub consists of these languages. Click on the icon below to access my GitHub.

The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a foundational tool in bolstering open science efforts. It is structured like a file folder system, with "Projects" being the main file, while subcomponents, like "Analysis" or "Code" being the files within. On my OSF, you will find a more detailed account of projects, an interface with GitHub to access code used in the project, and other components that typically make up a project, like the stimuli used and more. Click on the icon below to access my OSF.
