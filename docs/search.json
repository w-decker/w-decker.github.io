Adherence to such practices supports the transparent dissemination of information which concurrently increases the trust in the scientific community and allows research to be replicated and validated. Thusly, I have included some resources that I’ve found seminal in my personal development and understanding of what it means to conduct open science as well as the sites that I use to share the research that I am a part of and conduct.\nOpen science is a multi-tiered practice that consists of multiple concepts like reproducibility, accessibility, transparency, diversity and analytical rigor. It cannot simply be described in one paragraph and to understand it requires much more than the resources I’ve provided. I am still learning and will be continuing to learn about open science."

    "text": "Most notably, my interests fall within the field of cognitive neuroscience. I am generally curious about 1) learning, 2) language, 3) semantic knowledge and 4) neuroimaging. I am interested in how we learn and make sense of the complex visual, linguistic and auditory world around us. How do we learn language? How do we learn from, and extract meaning from complex visual, linguistic and auditory input? How do semantic systems and language systems interact? How can we understand the cognitive and computational mechanisms of learning and language using neuroimaging and computational models? These are just some of the many questions I am interested in pursuing.\nI am also severely interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.), their respective analyses and improvements to analyses (qualitatively and quantitatively). I am intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences our characterization of cognitive processes. Additionally, I am generally interested in and passionate about the structure-function relationship, open science, coding and statistics.\nOn top of being a student, I am a Project Coordinator in the Language, Environment and NeuroDevelopment (LEND) Lab under the mentorship of Julie M. Schneider, PhD where I have learned lots about EEG and the signal processing operations behind it and lead a team of other undergraduates in learning and conducting EEG experiments. I am also an honors thesis student in the Representations and Learning (ReLearn) Lab under the mentorship of Christopher Cox, PhD where I have delved deep into MRI, SL and much more.\nAdditionally, I am a big foodie and will eat practically anything. (Except raisins. Who wants a dried, shriveled grape when you can have a nice, juicy, good tasting one? They smell weird too.) I do enjoy my fair share of television; my favorite show is The Simpsons. In my free time, I enjoy walking around outside when the weather is nice and listening to my favorite song, “The Night Chicago Died” by Paper Lace, playing the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years), and coding (check out some of my cool coding projects/resourcs on my GitHub or in the Learning & Resources section).\nAt the moment, I am working towards entering a collaborative and open-science driven graduate program in Cognitive Psychology and/or Cognitive Neuroscience with opportunities to enhance my knowledge of language, neuroimaging, statistics and data science as well as receive detailed training in being a scientist of the brain."

However, there are fundamental differences between brands, electrodes, amplifiers that effect data and data collection. In this project, I evaluated the qulitative and quantitive differences between BrainVision’s EasyCap and R-Net–two caps that differ in there implementation and data collection. For example, the R-Net uses passive electrodes whereas the EasyCap uses active electrodes. (The distinction between “active” and “passive” electrodes is the place of amplification of the signal). We found significant differences in the data processing operations used during preprocessing and identified qualititative differences across caps as well.

    "text": "The Architecture of Auditory Statistical Learning\nStatistical learning (SL) is the neuro-cognitive mechanism that the brain employs to identify, parse and extract meaning from continuous input by identifying statistical patterns such as transitional probabilites (TPs). SL can be observed across a variety of cognitive domains and is particularly relevant in the language domain. It has been shown that langauge acquisition occurs through SL. However, previous neuroimaging studies characterize the learning of meaning via auditory SL as static when, rather, learning occurs across the temporal domain, employing various neural regions across space. The focus of this current project is to idetify the changes in functional “states” during SL to uncover how changes in learning are supported at the neural level. To do this, we can use fMRI and a sliding window correlation analysis to observe how functionally connected networks and regions are implicated in learning across time.\nKeywords: fMRI, statistical learning, langauge, dynamic functional connectivity"

If you are interested in the in-progress pipeline, check out the GitHub repo here where a detailed wiki has been constructed of everything completed thus far. If you are interested in the analysis being used, check out that GitHub repo here.\nIn recent years, a call for standardization of EEG preprocessing methods has been amplified and studies aimed at identifying the best preprocessing criterion determined that there exists some limited range of parameters one can process EEG data through before compromising data quality, statistical significance and reproducibility. However, this research primarily consisted of adult EEG data. Given the exogenous and endogenous impacts of developmental populations on EEG data, a distinct evaluation of the best preprocessing methods for developmental data must be made. This is—in short—the foundation of the project.\nKeywords: EEG, ERP, quality metrics, developmental"

Previous behavioral examinations into this exact phenomena through rhyme have demonstrated such an outcome, yet, the speed and depth of rhyme’s aid in word learning is not quite understood. To uncover the true nature of rhyme’s role in word learning, we used EEG and ERP methods to characterize this phenomena. We specifically examined the N400 ERP component and found a significant attenuation across exposure to our paradigm and deduced that rhyme may serve as a more implicit faclitator of encoding. The resultant poster from this project can be found here."
