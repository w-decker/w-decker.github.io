What/how do neural mechanisms allow us to accrue knowledge of our world? This is a core theme of my research. I work extensively with functional MRI (fMRI), a favorite tool of mine in the expansive \"cog-neuro toolkit.\" \n\n    Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I will complete my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Louisiana State University (LSU) where I am working with Christopher Cox and Julie M. Schneider. While at LSU, I have studied learning and language in adults and kids using fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG).\n  \n  \n    I enjoy The Simpsons. I have a favorite episode which I watch regurlarly (S8E23; Homer's Enemy).\n\n    In my free time, I play the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years) and code. I am an avid programmer and have found great utility in this skill (e.g., better logical abilities).\n\n    I also really like food and will eat practically anything. I'm not a big fan of raisins though. \n\n    My partner and I also have a few cats.\n  \n\n\n\n\nPictures\n\n\n  \n  \n  Click Through Pictures\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  Next"

    "text": "Learning and Resources\nTeaching a concept significantly increases one’s own understanding of that concept. I have tried to create cursory reviews of a few topics relevent to cognitive and computational neuroscience. These topics range from mathematical concepts, to coding and more.\nI have also created some resources that have streamlined my research, including \\(\\LaTeX\\) templates and custom coding modules. I’ve made them open-source for a reason!\nClick on the image within each card to access the resource.\n\n  roipy\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Plotting brain regions of interest (ROI) for demonstration purposes in Python.\n     Install via pip: pip install roipy==1.3 for the latest version.\n  \n\n\n\n  Static Functional Connectivity\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Execution of static functional connectivity analyses with nilearn to scaffold later pipelines. Equipped with custom module, sfc_demo, which contains different functionality for easily demonstrating static functional connectivity analyses. Click on the plot to be sent to the GitHub repo.\n  \n\n\n\n  APA LaTeX Template\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    LaTeX and Overleaf are great resources for (collaboratively) writing documents with ease. There are a million tutorials on YouTube. I recommend checking out  Dr. Trefor Bazett. Nonetheless, I have provided a template which follows APA criteria. To use it, complete the following steps:\n\n    \n    1. Fork the GitHub repository \n    \n    2. Create a new project in Overleaf \n    \n    3. Select “Import from GitHub” \n    \n    4. Select the forked “APA-Manuscript-Template” repo. \n\n    \n      And now you’re ready to write! \n  \n\n\n\n  Python Object Oriented Programming (POOP)\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    Object oriented programming (OOP) is an interesting way of coding and is difficult compared to the canonical “procedural” way of programming. Here, I provide only an introductory explanation of OOP with Python. Thus, this learning tool is aptly named “POOP”.\n  \n\n\n  Multiple Regression (sub) Components mrc\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    R functions for computing some fun components to multiple regression models. Clicking the plot above will take you to the GitHub repo. To install mrc in R, type the following in the R console.\n\n  \n        \n      devtools::install_github(\"w-decker/mrc\")\n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  Brain Stimulation with Izhikevich Model\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    The Izhikevich Model, developed in 2003, allows us to quantify the dynamic nature of neuronal circutry. Here, I provide an introduction to the mathematical models behind neuronal activity and using this to understand brain stimulation.\n  \n\n\n  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    What is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)? How is it used in cognitive neuroscience? Here I provide an understanding of the concepts underlying HMMs, HMMs in general, and relevant literature that makes use of Markovian processes. Click on the image above to learn more about HMMs!\n  \n\n\n  Building MATLAB Functions\n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    MATLAB is a powerful and widely used tool in cognitive neuroscience and building custom functions is important to optimizing your code. Here, I provide an understanding of building functions ranging in complexities."
