Adherence to such practices supports the transparent dissemination of information which concurrently increases the trust in the scientific community and allows research to be replicated and validated. Thusly, I have included some resources that I’ve found seminal in my personal development and understanding of what it means to conduct open science as well as the sites that I use to share the research that I am a part of and conduct.\nOpen science is a multi-tiered practice that consists of multiple concepts like reproducibility, accessibility, transparency, diversity and analytical rigor. It cannot simply be described in one paragraph and to understand it requires much more than the resources I’ve provided. I am still learning and will be continuing to learn about open science."

    "text": "Most notably, my interests and passions fall within the fields of cognitive neuroscience, and neuroimaging. I am particularly interested in 1) learning, 2) language and 3) semantic knowledge. More specifically I am interested in statistical learning (SL), the computations involved (i.e., transitional probabilities and chunking), the neural mechanisms supporting SL and how SL relates to, interacts with and recruits other cognitive mechanisms. I am also interested in how the human language network parallels that of a machine, how we generate and use language to learn and understand the world around us and how the learning of our environment shapes our language and understanding of concepts. Of particular intrigue is how the neurocognitive and neurobiological mechanisms of language and learning change over our developmental trajectory.\nI am also severely interested in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, EEG, MEG, etc.), their respective analyses, improvements to analyses and how we can use such techniques to study cognition. I am intrigued by how the brain can be broken down computationally and how this understanding influences our characterization of cognitive processes. Additionally, I am generally interested in and passionate about the structure-function relationship, open science, coding and statistics.\nOn top of being a student, I am a Project Coordinator in the Language, Environment and NeuroDevelopment (LEND) Lab under the mentorship of Julie M. Schneider, PhD where I have learned lots about EEG and the signal processing operations behind it and lead a team of other undergraduates in learning and conducting EEG experiments. I am also an honors thesis student in the Representations and Learning (ReLearn) Lab under the mentorship of Christopher Cox, PhD where I have delved deep into MRI, SL and much more.\nAdditionally, I am a big foodie and will eat practically anything. (Except raisins. Who wants a dried, shriveled grape when you can have a nice, juicy, good tasting one? They smell weird too.) I do enjoy my fair share of television; my favorite show–without a doubt–is The Simpsons. I also enjoy walking around outside when the weather is nice and listening to my favorite song, “The Night Chicago Died” by Paper Lace. I have also been playing the violin for 10+ years.\nAt the moment, I am working towards entering a collaborative and open-science driven graduate program in Cognitive Psychology and/or Cognitive Neuroscience with opportunities to enhance my knowledge of language, neuroimaging, statistics and data science as well as receive detailed training in being a scientist of the brain."

However, there are fundamental differences between brands, electrodes, amplifiers that effect data and data collection. In this project, I evaluated the qulitative and quantitive differences between BrainVision’s EasyCap and R-Net–two caps that differ in there implementation and data collection. For example, the R-Net uses passive electrodes whereas the EasyCap uses active electrodes. (The distinction between “active” and “passive” electrodes is the place of amplification of the signal). We found significant differences in the data processing operations used during preprocessing and identified qualititative differences across caps as well. This resultant poster from this project can be found here."

    "text": "The Architecture of Auditory Statistical Learning\nStatistical learning (SL) is the neurocognitive mechanism that the brain employs to identify, parse and extract meaning from continuous input via statistical computations such as transitional probabilites (TPs) and/or chunking. SL can be observed across a variety of cognitive domains and is particularly relevant in the language domain. It has been shown that langauge acquisition occurs through SL. However, previous neuroimaging studies characterize the learning of meaning via auditory SL as static when, rather, learning occurs across the temporal domain, employing various neural regions across space. The focus of this current project is to idetify the changes in functional “states” during SL to uncover how changes in learning are supported at the neural level. To do this, we can use fMRI and a sliding window correlation analysis (detailed by Vergara et al. (2019)). The code for this is currently being developed and can be found here on my GitHub. As of yet, the project is still being constructed.\nKeywords: fMRI, statistical learning, langauge, dynamic functional connectivity"

    "text": "Optimized Pipeline for Developmental ERPs\nI was recently awarded an LSU Discover Project Grant for the Summer 2023 semester to develop a pipeline for developmental EEG/ERP data. This project involves examining data quality metrics for developmental EEG/ERP data and identifying optimized preprocessing operations from such data with the ultimate end goal of producing an open-access, easily executable pipeline for researchers. If you are interested in the in-progress pipeline, check out the GitHub repo here where a detailed wiki has been constructed of everything completed thus far. If you are interested in the analysis being used, check out that GitHub repo here.\nIn recent years, a call for standardization of EEG preprocessing methods has been amplified and studies aimed at identifying the best preprocessing criterion determined that there exists some limited range of parameters one can process EEG data through before compromising data quality, statistical significance and reproducibility. However, this research primarily consisted of adult EEG data. Given the exogenous and endogenous impacts of developmental populations on EEG data, a distinct evaluation of the best preprocessing methods for developmental data must be made. This is—in short—the foundation of the project.\nKeywords: EEG, ERP, quality metrics, developmental"
