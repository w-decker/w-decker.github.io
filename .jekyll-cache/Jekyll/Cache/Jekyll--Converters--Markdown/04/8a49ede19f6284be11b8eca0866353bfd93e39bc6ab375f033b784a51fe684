I"J<h1 id="about-me">About Me!</h1>

<p>I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech and the <a href="https://www.language-intelligence-thought.net/">Language, Intelligence and Thought (LIT) Lab</a>, where I will work with <a href="https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/anna-ivanova">Prof. Anna (Anya) Ivanova</a> in the School of Psychology.</p>

<p>My work takes a computational and neuroscientific approach (which itself is highly interdisciplinary) to investigate learning and language in minds, brains, and machines. What/how do neural mechanisms allow us to accrue knowledge of our world? How can neuroscience influence the architecture of artificial neural networks? What does AI tell us about language in the brain? These are a few core themes of my research interests. I work extensively with functional MRI (fMRI), a favorite tool of mine in the expansive “cog-neuro toolkit.”</p>

<p>Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I will complete my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Louisiana State University (LSU) where I am working with <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/hss/psychology/faculty/cognitive/cox.php">Christopher Cox</a> and <a href="https://juschnei.wixsite.com/lendlab/dr-julie-m-schneider">Julie M. Schneider</a>. While at LSU, I have studied learning and language in adults and kids using fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG).</p>

<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>

<p>My favorite TV show is The Simpsons. I have a favorite episode which I watch regurlarly (S8E23; <em>Homer’s Enemy</em>).</p>

<p>In my free time, I play the violin (which I have been doing for 10+ years) and code. I am an avid programmer and have found great utility in this skill (e.g., better logical abilities). I enjoy reading but mostly stick to science-y topics.</p>

<p>I also really like food and will eat practically anything. I’m not a big fan of raisins though.</p>
