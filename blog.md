## Computer Programming in Psychology
#### _May 12, 2024_

>Before reading, I must relay that I am no software engineer; all coding knowledge I possess has been about 90% self-taught. As such, there may be a point or two you disagree with or find misrepresenting of the computer science community. If so, email me!

<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Why?</summary>
<br>
<p>I think a one-dimensional answer to the question posed in this section's title is <i>"to make things easier"</i>. Yes, this is true, but what <i>"things"</i> need to be streamlined? Psychological data has increasingly become larger and more complex. Gone are the days when you might compute a t-test by hand for a publishable project; journals are looking for gaudier figures who describe methods and more; and data are quite complex. In this inaugural blog post, I will describe some valuable use cases of computer programming in Psychological Sciences. There's also a lot that I don't touch on. Let me know what you think!</p>

<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Use case #1: Data cleaning</summary>
<br>
<p>Seldom is the raw data you acquire from an experiment suitable for statistical analysis. Even a simple behavioral experiment might have missing data points that must be checked, or an individual may exceed some variability threshold required for inclusion and need to be removed from the dataset. Sure...something like this could be done in Excel. So why might you want to do this with code? Simple:</p>

<p>1. It's faster.</p>

<p>2. It's easily reproducible.</p>

<p>The "point-and-click" methods with Excel can only take you so far. If you are working with lots of data points, a more systematic approach is necessary. With code, others can execute the same processes you employed at a similar speed. Efficiency is important. By recruiting less energy for such mundane tasks, more effort can be put into other important aspects of the research process.</p>

<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"> Use case #2: Statistical analysis</summary>
<br>
<p>Nowadays, it is easy to compute statistical tests with little effort. Software like SPSS takes an "Excel-esque approach" to running many tests. The user is more involved in individual steps of the computation. In contrast, programming languages like R provide support for a wide variety of tests, models, and computations in a programmatic manner. This makes it easy to reproduce statistical tests and avoid careless errors. You can also share your code with others.</p> 

<p>More specifically, a language like R-which is open source-has a wide support community, compiles *relatively* fast, and integrates data cleaning, statistical testing and data visualization into one. Learning to code in R is a great way to boost productivity.</p>

<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"> Use case #3: Data viz</summary>
<br>
<p>Data visualization is important. I often find myself critiquing a publication's figures. Communicating a concept in a discrete way using 2-dimensional visualizations can be difficult. But, with certain packages like <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> for R and Python, respectively, creating figures is very easy. Most of these packages take some common data structures of that language anyway, so no transformation to some data type is needed.</p> 

<p>Now, making publishable figures might require additional refinement with either more complex code or some image software. However, using these tools is a requisite starting point for generating high-quality images of data.</p> 
</details>

<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Which language to choose/to learn?</summary>
<br>
<p>There are many things to consider when choosing a programming language. Many people are <i>very</i> passionate about which programming language to first learn and which is most suitable for a type of project. My simplest answer to this question: learn Python.</p>

<p>Python is known by many people and is easy to learn. It can also do almost anything you need. It is one of the only languages that <i>I</i> believe executes all three use cases easily, no matter your programming experience. Learning R is a good idea, too, especially in Psychological Science.</p>

<p>I could write an entire blog post about which programming language to learn...so I won't speak too much on this. But, in short, if you have zero coding experience but need some to successfully do research, learn Python and/or R.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Final thoughts</summary>
<br>
<p>Learning to code is a technical ability becoming increasingly necessary in many domains of academia and industry. Personally, I enjoy coding but find myself continuously learning how to code better. This blog post barely touches the surface but, if anything, demonstrates the need for educators to cast a wider net when thinking about who should learn how to code.</p>

## What's this for?
#### _May 1, 2024_

I have been meaning to put together a blog-like medium for a little while now, but could never settle on what I wanted to discuss. Here, I intend to talk about whatever, including some science, personal stuff, food, and more. This blog is different from some of the [**resources**](resources.html) I have scraped together, and more informal. So...stay tuned!
